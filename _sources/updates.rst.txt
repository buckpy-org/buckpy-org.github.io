************
 #. The residual buckling force is capped by the minimum critical buckling force (CBF). Check the
    `calc_friction_force_from_buckle()` function in the ``buckpy_solver.py`` for more details.
 #. Create ``Updates`` Section in the Buckpy Manual.
 #. Fix the characteristic friction bug for sleepers.
 #. Fix the probability of buckling rounding number issue.
 #. Add BuckPy and Saipem Pro-Buck Benchmark section in the BuckPy Manual.
 #. Add the description of direct inputs of Critical Buckling Force Distributions 
    at engineered buckle locations in the BuckPy Manual.
 #. The soil axial friction distribution has two options: Normal or Lognormal.
 #. Add two more examples: ``inputDataTemplateB.xlsx`` for simple sleepers 
    and ``inputDataTemplateC.xlsx`` for RCM route type.

 #. When plotting the BuckPy characteristic lateral breakout friction with buckles, replace the
    friction with zero if the probability of buckling is less than 5% in the element set. Check the
    ``buckfast_output_file_compiler.py`` in the folder '`docs/_static/buckfast file writers`'.
 #. Update the ``Getting Started`` section in the BuckPy Manual based on changes in the
    input files and output results.

*************
 #. Output the combination of buckling set results based on the post-processing set and 
    route section set. Plot only the most frequent combination of buckling set.
    Check the `pp_comb_buckles_per_set()`, `pp_comb_buckles_per_set()`, `plot_comb_per_set()` and 
    `plot_comb_per_section()` functions in the ``buckpy_post_processing.py`` for more details.
 #. The combination of buckling set results are in the ``Comb Buckles per Set`` and
    ``Comb Buckles per Section`` tabs of the output file.
 #. Create an option to output and plot the combination of buckling set results using
    `OUTPUT_COMBINATION` in the ``buckpy.py`` and `PLOT_COMBINATION` in the
    ``buckfast_output_file_compiler.py``.
 #. Create a summary table Excel file for Buckfast results and plots to compare Buckfast 
    and BuckPy results. Check the ``buckfast_output_file_compiler.py``
    in the folder '`docs/_static/buckfast file writers`'.
 #. Calculate the parameters of a lognormal distribution for CBF. Check the `calc_cbf_mean_std()`
    function in the ``buckfast_input_file_writer.py`` in the folder '`docs/_static/buckfast file writers`'.
 #. Create functions to plot a second figue of the BuckPy results. Check the `plot_buckpy()` function in the 
    ``buckpy_visualisation.py`` for more details.

*************
October 2024
*************
 #. Create functions to read the raw operating profiles and interpolate RLT, pressure and 
    temperature along the KP. Check the `calc_operating_profiles()` function in the 
    ``buckpy_preprocessing.py`` for more details.
 #. Output and plot the geotechnical lateral friction. Check the `pp_sets()` function in the
    ``buckpy_post_processing.py`` for more details.
