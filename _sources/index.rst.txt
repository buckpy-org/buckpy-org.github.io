BuckPy (Probabilistic Lateral Buckling Algorithm)
#################################################

******************
Project Philosophy
******************
 `Xodus Group <https://www.xodusgroup.com/>`_ (hereafter referred to as Xodus) and
 `TotalEnergies OneTech <https://totalenergies.com/>`_ (hereafter referred to as TTE OneTech)
 have co-written **BuckPy**.
 
 **BuckPy** is an open-source algorithm that has been developed to facilitate the implementation
 of the probabilistic lateral buckling methodology presented in the paper published by Ismael Ripoll,
 Carlos Sicilia and Emilien Bonnet at the 2023 Subsea Pipeline Technology Congress in London (SPT 2023).

 Xodus and TTE OneTech have decided jointly to make `BuckPy <https://github.com/Xodus-Group/plba>`_ available
 with the intend of allowing the pipeline community to review, expand and use it under a
 `GNU General Public License v3.0 <https://github.com/Xodus-Group/plba/blob/main/LICENSE>`_.

BuckPy Python Library Versions
******************************
 THE REQUIREMENTS.txt file contains the libraries for which the script has been developed and shown to run:

  - python 3.11
  - tkinter 8.6
  - matplotlib 3.8.3
  - multiprocess 0.70.16
  - numba 0.59.0
  - numpy 1.26.4
  - openpyxl 3.1.5
  - pandas 2.2.1
  - scipy 1.12.0
  - xlrd 2.0.1
  - XlsxWriter 3.2.0
  - sphinx 8.2.3
  - pydata-sphinx-theme

 Before running BuckPy for first time, follow these steps to activate a virtual environment from the REQUIREMENTS.TXT file:

  1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the folder where BuckPy is cloned.

  2. To create the virtual environment, run:

     `$ python -m venv env`

  3. To activate the virtual environement, run: [This command works in the VSCode's PowerShell. Command may vary in other shells]

     `$ env/Scripts/Activate.ps1`

  4. To install the necessary libraries, run:

     `$ pip install -r ./REQUIREMENTS.txt`

 Afterwards, the virtual environement must be activated before running BuckPy by using the command in Step 3.
